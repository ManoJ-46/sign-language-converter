Just a normal streamlit ui based sign language to english alphabet converter, only live cam option is available.
v1.py for the only live cam detection.
v2.py for the live cam + text to sign language converter.
v3.py same like v2.py but we have used tts.

installation details
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run v3.py

ok bye
